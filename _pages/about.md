I am a PhD candidate in financial economics at the Yale School of Management.  My research focuses on asset pricing, behavioral finance, financial econometrics, text data, and high-dimensional Bayesian statistics.  Before Yale, I was a researcher at the Booth School of Business, received a master's degree in statistics from the University of Michigan, and completed my undergraduate degree in economics at the University of Chicago.
